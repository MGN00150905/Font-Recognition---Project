# Font-Recognition---Project
Building a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) Model that identifies fonts. 
I am using a dataset of character font images. This dataset has 153 font classes. Some are images are scanned from devices while others are computer generated.

> Throughout this project, I will be working on how to load and manage this CSV data. 

> Then I will build a convolutional neural network, train and test the model with this dataset using Keras. 

> Finally I will load the finished model onto a Flask app.

> I want to keep it simple by prompting the user to upload an image to identify.

> I also want the model to output the confidence of its result.

> Once this has been achieved I will attempt to identify font characters in real-time through a web cam.

> Further development of this project would include moving it to a React Native Application so that people can use it Android/IOS devices.
